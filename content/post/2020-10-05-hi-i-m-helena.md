Hi! My name is Helena Bouchard and I am a senior majoring in Sociology and minoring in Statistics. I am from Nashville, Tennessee and live with my mom and three dogs. I have a passion for working with animals and spending time in nature. I plan to go to law school to study animal law. 

My group, WHYM, has found an interesting dataset called the 'Final Report of the Asian-American Quality of Life.' This dataset has 2610 rows and 231 columns, showing data such as age, gender, ethnicity, education completed, employment status, mental health status, etc. There are qualitative values, numeric values, and dummy variables. Although we have not yet narrowed it down, I think it would be interesting to study how mental health differs among different ethnicities, employment status among different ethnicites, and how one's language affects one's income level.
