Our dataset is titled the 'Final Report of the Asian American Quality of Life' (AAQoL) and was retrieved from the official City of Austin open data portal: www.data.austintexas.gov. The data contains 231 variables from 2,610 subjects. The included variables assess demographics such as language, marital status, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status. The data also includes measures to assess mental health, perceived quality of life, and medical history.

This data was gathered in response to the rapidly growing Asian American population, in order to better understand the social and health needs of the Asian American population and the unique challenges they face. 

WHYM is hoping to explore how certain factors such as language barriers, employment status, sense of community, and income level influence mental well-being and quality of life in Asian Americans. Given the large sample size and the extensive variables collected, WHYM feels this data is adequate to address these questions. However, WHYM recognizes in order for our findings to be more generalizable, data that includes samples of other ethnic and racial groups would be both helpful and necessary.
