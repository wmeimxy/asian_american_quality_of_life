My name is Yanru Chen. I am a senior at Boston University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in mathematics. My interest and research focus is on cloud computing, specifically machine learning gaming on cloud. The topic that I found most interesting, but also challenging, is theory of computation. My favorite games (currently) are Dead by Daylight and Overwatch.

The data my team is pursuing are about relate to social events. My initial thought would also target towards using data to analyze social events because I have not decided on what aspect of social events I want to work with.
