My name is Winnie Mei. I am a Junior at Boston University majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science and Visual Arts. I am from China and I moved to MA years ago. I have a great interest in the statistics and data fields as well as using statistical methods to perform real-life researches.I plan to attend graduate school after graduation and continue my study in either statistics or bio-statistics.

The dataset that my team is working on is about life quality for Asian Americans. My initial thought is to explore any potential social factors, such as income level, unemployment rate, and discrimination that might affect the life quality of Asian American.
