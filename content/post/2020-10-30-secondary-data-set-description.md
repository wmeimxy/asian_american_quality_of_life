Our second dataset is The National Asian American Survey (NAAS) Pre-election Survey, [United States], 2016 (ICPSR 37024). The dataset was retreived www.icpsr.umich.edu, The Resource Center for Minority Data website. This data contains 316 total variables and 4,787 observations. Variables include demographic data and questionnaire responses regarding political opinions and views of Asian Americans prior to the 2016 Presidential election. 

We anticipate challenges merging this data with our first dataset, the Asian American Quality of Life Survey, given the large amount of variables in this second dataset. Moreover, combining these two datasets may produce results that lack generalizability given the difference of demographics in the two samples. Furthermore, the AAQoL data was collected in 2013, while the NAAS data was collected in 2016. This inconsistency may also produce variability in results. To address the difference in demographics, we may filter the NAAS dataset to observations collected in Texas, if feasible. 

We hope to use the combined data to examine trends in political attitudes and how they may differ across different Asian American ethnic groups, income level, education levels, and overall quality of life. Given the polarity of the 2016 Presidential election, we may also explore potential gender, religious, and age differences in political affiliation.
