Hi! My name is Maya Joshi Delity and I am a senior at Boston University majoring in Psychology with a minor Statistics. I hope to pursue my PhD in Clinical Psychology, with a research focus in Health Psychology/Behavioral Medicine. Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, baking, and trying new foods! 

For this project, my group and I are interested in investigating quality of life or mental well-being measures in immigrant or minority populations in the United States. OUr hope is to work with a large data set so that we have a large range of variables that we can explore and manipulate.
