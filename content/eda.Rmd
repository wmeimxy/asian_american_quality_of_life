## Exploratory Data Analysis

As we explored the data, we realized that statistical analyses would be difficult to conduct with so many levels in our variables. Thus, we created three levels of Quality of Life: Low (Scores 1-3), Medium (Scores 4-6), and High (7-10). We also grouped the Political Topic/Political Policy Priority into 4 groups for the purpose of our data analysis. The groups are Economy/Jobs (Income Gaps, Taxes, Education, and Jobs), Government Policy (Immigration, Terrorism, National Security, Social Security, and Government Corruption), Human Rights (Racism, Sexism, and Discrimination), and Other. 

The questions we explored are:

* How does income level for Asian Americans change depending on one's educational level?
* How do education and income levels relate to quality of life in Asian Americans?
  + Does the relationship extend to mental health? 
* How do education and income levels relate to political attitude in Asian Americans?
  + Does the relationship extend to the likelihood of voting?
  + Does the relationship extend to what political topic people identify as most important (political priority)?

```{r clean quality of life, include=FALSE}
for(i in seq_along(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life)){
  if(!is.na(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]])){
    if(identical(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]], "1") |identical(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]], "2") |
       identical(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]], "3")){
          Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]] = "Low"
    }else if(identical(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]], "4")| identical(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]], "5")| identical(Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]], "6")){
      Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]] = "Med"
    }else{
      Final_dataset$Quality_of_Life[[i]] = "High"
    }
  }
}
```

```{r topic clean categories, include= FALSE}
Final_dataset$Topic_Important <- as.character(Final_dataset$Topic_Important)
for(i in seq_along(Final_dataset$Topic_Important)){
  if(!is.na(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]])){
    if(identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Incomes/Gap between rich and poor")| identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Taxes")|
       identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Education")| 
       identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Economy/Jobs")){
      Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]]= "Economy/Education"
    }else if(identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Immigration")| identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Terrorism/ISIS/National security") |identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Social security")|identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Government/Broken political system")) {
      Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]]= "Government Policies"
    }else if(identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Racism or Racial discrimination")| identical(Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]], "Sexism or Gender discrimination")){
      Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]]= "Human Rights"
    }else{
      Final_dataset$Topic_Important[[i]]= "Healthcare"
    }
  }
}
```


## Demographic Graphs 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

Final_dataset %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=Ethnicity, fill = 'Red')) + ggtitle("Ethnicity") + 
  coord_flip()
Final_dataset %>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=Education, fill = 'Red')) + ggtitle("Education")
Final_dataset %>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=clean_Income, fill = 'Red')) + ggtitle("Income Levels")
```


## EDA Graphs


## Quality of Life
To better understand how income and education levels interact with perceived quality of life, we made the following graphs: 
```{r QoL Income}
Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(clean_Income)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Quality_of_Life)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Quality_of_Life, fill = clean_Income)) + 
  geom_bar() + scale_fill_brewer(name = "Income Level", palette = "Accent") + 
  xlab("Count") + ylab("Quality of Life") + 
  ggtitle("Income Level and Quality of Life") 
```

This graph illustrates that the majority of our sample has a high quality of life. Of those who have a high quality of life, the majority earn $70,000 and over. 


```{r QoL Educ}
Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Education)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Quality_of_Life)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Quality_of_Life, fill = Education)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(name = "Education", palette = "Accent") + 
  xlab("Count") + ylab("Quality of Life") + 
  ggtitle(" Education and Quality of Life") 
```

This graph further highlights that our sample is highly educated (College or Higher) and that the majority have a high percieved quality of life. 


## Mental Health
Since we found that our sample does not have a lot of variation in quality of life (majority have a high percieved quality of life), we decided to explore how income and education levels may relate to mental health, a more specific factor that can also provide some insights about the quality of life in Asian Americans. 

```{r MentalHealth Income}
Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(clean_Income)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Mental_Health)) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=Mental_Health, fill=clean_Income)) + 
  ggtitle('Income and Mental Health') + 
  scale_fill_brewer(name = 'Income Level', palette="PiYG") + 
  ylab("Count") + xlab("Mental Health Rating")
```

```{r MentalHealth Educ}
 Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Education)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Mental_Health)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=Mental_Health, fill=Education)) +
  ggtitle('Education and Mental Health') + 
  scale_fill_brewer(name = 'Education Level', palette="PiYG") + 
  ylab("Count") + xlab("Mental Health Rating")
```

These graphs show that mental health is good across all income and education levels. The majority of our sample identified their mental health as "very good". 


## Political Topic Priorities
To better understand how education level and income level impact political priorities and values, we made the following graphs: 

```{r income policy}
income_topic <- Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Topic_Important), !is.na(clean_Income)) %>%
  select(Topic_Important,clean_Income, Age)

income_topic %>% 
  count(Topic_Important, clean_Income) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=n, fill= Topic_Important)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
  facet_wrap(~clean_Income) + 
  ggtitle("Income and Political Priority") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(name="Political Priority", palette="Spectral")
```

This graph illustrates the breakdown of political topic priorities by income levels. Across income levels, a small portion of the sample identified human rights as a political topic that was most important to them. The two political topics that the majority of Asian Americans in our sample identified as most important to them were Economy/Education and Healthcare. 

```{r q4}
income_topic <- Final_dataset %>%
  filter(!is.na(Topic_Important), !is.na(Education)) %>%
  select(Topic_Important, Education, Age)

income_topic %>%
  count(Topic_Important, Education) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=n, fill= Topic_Important)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
  facet_wrap(~Education) + 
  ggtitle("Education Level and Political Priority") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(name="Political Priority", palette="Dark2")
```

This graph illustrates the breakdown of political topic priorities by education levels. Of those with a college education or higher, the majority identified Healthcare as the political topic most important to them. Of those with less than a high school education, the majority identified economy/jobs as political topic most important to them.

## Chance of Voting 
We explored how income and education would impact the likelihood of voting in Asian Americans. 

```{r}
income_topic <- Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Chance_Vote), !is.na(clean_Income)) %>% 
  select(Chance_Vote, clean_Income)

income_topic %>% 
  count(Chance_Vote, clean_Income) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=n, fill= Chance_Vote)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
  facet_wrap(~clean_Income) + 
  ggtitle("Income vs. Likelihood of Voting")
```
This graph illustrates that across income levels, the majority of Asian Americans were "absolutley certain that they would vote".


```{r}
income_topic <- Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Chance_Vote), !is.na(Education)) %>% 
  select(Chance_Vote, Education)

income_topic %>% count(Chance_Vote, Education) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=n, fill= Chance_Vote)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
  facet_wrap(~Education) + 
  ggtitle("Education vs. Likelihood of Voting")
```
This graph illustrates that of those with a high school education, the majority of our sample "are absolutely certain they wil vote". In other education levels, a significant portion "are absolutely certain they will vote", however, it a less overwhelming majority compared to those who have completed a college education or higher. 


## Chi Square Tests
Since our data is predominantly categorical variables, we ran chi square tests to determine if there are relationships between our variables of interest. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we rejected the null hypothesis, which is that the two variables are independent. The alternative hypothesis is then that there is a significant relationship between the two variables.

Income and Education: Chi Square Test
```{r chi sq income v educ}
library(gplots)
Income_vs_Edc <-Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(clean_Income), !is.na(Education))
chi9<-  table(Income_vs_Edc$clean_Income, Income_vs_Edc$Education)
test9 <- chisq.test(chi9)
balloonplot(t(chi9), main ="Education", xlab ="", ylab="", 
            label = FALSE, show.margins = FALSE)
```
There is a significant relationship between income and education. From the results of the chi-square test and the graph shown above, we can see that the probability of getting a higher education increases as the income level increases. 

Income and Quality of Life: Chi Square Test
```{r}
Income_vs_Q <- Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Quality_of_Life), Quality_of_Life !=0, !is.na(clean_Income))
chi1 <- table(Income_vs_Q$Quality_of_Life, Income_vs_Q$clean_Income)
test1 <- chisq.test(chi1)
test1$p.value
```
There is a significant relationship between income and Quality of Life. 

Education and Quality of Life: Chi Square Test
```{r}
Ed_vs_Q <-Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Education), !is.na(Quality_of_Life))
chi3<-  table(Ed_vs_Q$Education, Ed_vs_Q$Quality_of_Life)
test3 <- chisq.test(chi3, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
test3$p.value
```
There is a significant relationship between education and Quality of Life. 

Income and Political Priority: Chi Square Test
```{r}
Income_vs_Topic <-Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Topic_Important), !is.na(clean_Income))
chi2<-  table(Income_vs_Topic$Topic_Important, Income_vs_Topic$clean_Income)
test2 <- chisq.test(chi2)
test2$p.value
```
There is NOT a significant relationship between income and political priority - they are independent of each other. 

Education and Political Priority: Chi Square Test
```{r}
Education_vs_Topic <-Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Topic_Important), !is.na(Education))
chi5<-  table(Education_vs_Topic$Topic_Important, Education_vs_Topic$Education)
test5 <- chisq.test(chi5)
test5$p.value
```
There is a significant relationship between education and political priority 

Education and Mental Health: Chi Square Test
```{r}
Ed_vs_Mental <-Final_dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Education), !is.na(Mental_Health))
chi4<-  table(Ed_vs_Mental$Education, Ed_vs_Mental$Mental_Health)
test4 <- chisq.test(chi4, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
test4$p.value
```
There is a significant relationship between Education and Mental Health

The following table summarizes the results of the chi square tests. Note that in the table, 'significant' indicates that the p-value is less than 0.05 and thus, the there exists a relationship between the two variables. 
```{r}
chitabble <- matrix(c("Income", "Education", test9$p.value,"Significant", 
                      "Income", "Quality of Life", test1$p.value,"Significant",
                      "Education", "Quality of Life",test3$p.value, "Significant",
                      "Income", "Policy Priority",test2$p.value,"Not Significant",
                      "Education", "Policy Priority",test5$p.value, "Significant",
                      "Education", "Mental Health", test4$p.value,
                      "Significant"),ncol=4,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(chitabble)<-c("Variable 1", "Variable 2", "P-value", "Significance")
rownames(chitabble)<- c("Test 1","Test 2", "Test 3", 
                        "Test 4", "Test 5", "Test 6" )
chitabble <- as.table(chitabble)

knitr::kable(chitabble)
```

## Multinomial Regression and Probability Tables

To investigate the relationship between income, education, quality of life, and political attitude, we performed the following multinomial regression tests.
First, we explore the relationship between income and education, which answers our first question: How does income level for Asian Americans change depending on one's educational level?
```{r}
library(nnet)
library(effects)
Edc_Income<- multinom(clean_Income ~ Education, data = Final_dataset)
plot(Effect("Education", Edc_Income))
```

The graphs shows that the probability of earning higher income increases as one's educational level increases. The probability of earning a lower income decreases as one's educational level increases. 

To determine if education and income have an effect on Quality of Life, we ran the following multinomial logistic regression.
```{r}

mul_QoL<- multinom(Quality_of_Life ~ Education +
                     clean_Income, data = Final_dataset)

z <- summary(mul_QoL)$coefficients/summary(mul_QoL)$standard.errors
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z), 0, 1)) * 2
p
```

These results indicate that, for our sample...
 
* The odds that you have a low quality of life than a high quality of life are not different depending on your education level. 
* However, the odds that you have a medium quality of life versus a high quality of life are significantly different whether you are a high school graduate or a college graduate.
* The odds that you have a medium quality of life versus a high quality of life are significantly different whether you have less than a high school education or are a college graduate. 
* The odds that you have a low quality of life versus a high quality of life are significantly different if you make $70,000 and over than if you make $20,000 or less. 
* For all other income groups, the odds that you have a low quality of life compared to a high quality of life are not different than if you make $20,000 or less. 
* The odds that you have a medium quality of life versus a high quality of life are significantly different whether you make $50,000 and above or $20,000 or less. 

These results can be interpreted in the context of our sample as follows: 

* Education level impacts quality of life to a certain extent. While they do not account for differentiations in low and high quality of life, education levels do effect the difference between a medium and high quality of life. Specifically, having a college degree or higher versus having a high school degree or less, impacts the odds of quality of life. 
* Income level impacts quality of live at a certain threshold. The difference between a low quality of life versus a high quality of life is only significant between the highest income bracket in our sample ($70,000 and above) and the lowest income bracket in our smaple ($20,000 or less). The difference between a medium quality of life and a high quality of life is affected by income level depending on whether you make $50,000 and above or $20,000 or less.

Probability table for Quality of Life vs. Education and Income Levels
```{r}
Final_dataset %>% 
  select(Quality_of_Life, Education, clean_Income) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Quality_of_Life), !is.na(Education), !is.na(clean_Income)) %>%
  count(Quality_of_Life, Education, clean_Income) %>% 
  mutate(proportions = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% arrange(desc(proportions)) %>% 
  knitr::kable() 
```
This table represents the conditional probabilities for each category of Quality of Life, Income Level, and Education Level. 


To determine if education and income have an effect on Political Priorities, we ran the following multinomial logistic regression.
```{r}
mul_Topic<- multinom(Topic_Important ~ Education + 
                       clean_Income, data = Final_dataset)
z1 <- summary(mul_Topic)$coefficients/summary(mul_Topic)$standard.errors
p1 <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z1), 0, 1)) * 2
p1
```

These results indicate that...

* The odds that one prioritizes Government Policies versus Economy/Education are significantly different whether they have less than a high school education or a college degree. 
* The odds that one prioritizes Healthcare versus Economy/Education are significantly different whether they have a college degree or a high school degree or less. 
* The odds that one prioritizes Human Rights versus Economy/Education are significantly different whether they have less than a high school education or a college degree. 
* The odds that one prioritizes Government Policies versus Economy/Education are NOT significantly different across any income level. 
* The odds that one prioritizes Healthcare versus Economy/Jobs are significantly different whether they make over $20,000 or less that $20,000. 
* The odds that one prioritizes Human Rights versus Economy/Jobs are NOT significantly different across any income level. 

These results can be interpreted as follows: 

* Education level impacts what political topics are most important to people. Specifically, having a college education compared to having a high school education or less affects what political topic one prioritizes. One's education level will influence their political values.
* Income level does not generally impact which political topics are most important to people. 


Probability table for Policy Priority vs. Education and Income Levels
```{r}
Final_dataset %>% 
  select(Topic_Important, Education, clean_Income) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Topic_Important), !is.na(Education), !is.na(clean_Income)) %>%
  count(Topic_Important, Education, clean_Income) %>% 
  mutate(proportions = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  arrange(desc(proportions)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

This table represents the conditional probabilities for each category of Political Priority (Topic_Important), Income Level, and Education Level.
