## Data Page

11/12 points

* Describe where/how to find data.(3pt)
You must include a link to the original data source(s). From what you can tell, why was the data collected/curated? 

3/3

* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. (3pt)
If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.

3/3

* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data. (3pt)
You *must* include a link to your load_and_clean_data.R file.
Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
Describe how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
Some repetition of what you do in your load_and_clean_data.R file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.

Should be a link to a .R file.

2/3

* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page (3pt)
Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other tools, etc.

3/3

## EDA Page(s)

28/33 points


NOTE: Your EDA can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.

* Introduce what motivates your EDA (3pt)
Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
 What questions are you interested in answering?

3/3

* Breadth of the EDA (3pt)
This is to make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.
i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?

3/3


* Depth of the EDA (5pt)
When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well. The depth of the EDA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.

5/5

* Modeling and Inference (5 pt)
You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
Describe the results of your modeling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.

Pretty good but some of the big tables could probably be removed or modified to increase clarity.

I like the explanations of the ods.

4/5

* Clarity Figures (8pt)
Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.


High, Medium, Low should be a factor so its sorted correctly on figures. Same with Excellent, Fair, Good, etc.

Pie charts are OK but it would be good to explain why some are not full circles.

6/8

* Clarity of Explanations (6pt)
Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
How well do you explain each figure/result?
Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?

There is not much explanation for a few figures.

7/6


* Organization and cleanliness. (3pt)
Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.

Overall a lot of code output that could probably be removed.

2/3


## Big Picture Page

26/30 points

This page should have no code visible, i.e. use echo=FALSE.

* Title (2pt)
Your big picture page should have a creative title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.

2/2

* Clarity of Explanation (10pt)
You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into to much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible).

p-values aren't appropriate for the audience.

9/10

* Quality of Figures (10pt)
Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose.

Figure labels should not have underscores.

Overall OK. I would have tried free scales for some of the plots since you had a lot of apparently flat curves but at low values.

8/10


* Creativity (10pt)
Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.

OK. The different plots feel somewhat disconnected and a main message doesn't really come through.

7/8


## Interactive component and Video

14/17 points

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components. (10pt)
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conlusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text does not count.

No dashboard.

This mostly shows pretty high level views of the data and comparisons are kind of hard. It would have been good to see both high-level and details in a more unified plot.

7/10


* Video Recording (7 pt)
Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.

7/7

## Rest of the Site

7/8 points

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.

Didn't remove generic posts.
