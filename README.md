## Does Resource Inequality Affect Asian Americans’ Quality of Life and Political Attitudes?

Resource inequality can be described as the process in which resources in a given society are distributed unequally, specifically between different ethnic groups and gender groups. As a result, we often see massive gaps in income level and educational attainment, which often affect many areas of one’s life. We chose to explore how income and education level in particular affect Asian Americans’ overall quality of life, and, as an extension, their political attitudes. Asian Americans’ are underrepresented in most research samples. The current project aims to shed light onto the unique experiences of Asian Americans.

Thesis: The current project aims to investigate the extent to which education levels and income levels influence perceived quality of life and political attitudes.

The questions we explored are:

How does income level for Asian Americans change depending on one’s educational level?
How do education and income levels relate to quality of life in Asian Americans?
Does the relationship extend to mental health?
How do education and income levels relate to political attitude in Asian Americans?
Does the relationship extend to the likelihood of voting?
Does the relationship extend to what political topic people identify as most important (political priority)?
